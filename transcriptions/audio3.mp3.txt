 Why is there so much hype for Shivaji Maharaj when there were many powerful kings like King Ashoka, Harsha, Chandragupta Maurya did a much better job than him? Because all these kings had a kingdom, ruled people, did a really good job. But Shivaji was not like that. He did not have a kingdom. When there were so many atrocities happening in the country, festivals were banned, temples were being destroyed, people got killed, he rose up to be a revolutionary. He did not become a king because his father was a king. His father was actually working in the Mughal government. There was no Maratha empire. It was people's war against Aurangzeb and Shivaji lit that fire. He led those people. That too against Aurangzeb, the most cruel and powerful Mughal emperor. I think he is being celebrated as a symbol of courage, as a symbol of revolution.
